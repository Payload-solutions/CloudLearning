# MicroBacterian description.
    - We've distinguished tree class of crop
        - initial crop.
        - mother crop.
        - usual crop.
    
### Description:
    - the cell envelope comprises the inner cell membrane and the
        cell wall of a bacterium. In gram-negative and bacteria an
        outer membraned is also included. This envelope is not
        present in the Mollicutes where the cell wall is absent.
        
    - Bacterial cell envelopes fall into two major categories:
        * a gram-positive type and gram negative type, distinguished
        
        
        
#### Gram-positive bacteria: Violet
    - In bacteriology, gram-positive bacteria are bacteria that give
        positive result in the Gram stain test, which is traditionally used to quickly classify bacteria into two broad categories according to their type of cell wall.
        
        
     - Gram-positive bacteria take up the crystal violent stain
         used in the test, and then appear to be purple-coloured
         when seen through an optical microscope, this is because
         the thick peptidoglycan layer in the bacterial cell wall
         retauns the stain.
         
         
#### Gram-negative bacteria: Red intense



## Principal purpose of (LAB) Lactic Acid Bacteria:
    
    - Make acid taste.
    - Inhibition of pathogenic organisms.
    - gelling of milk.
    - reduction of lactose content.
    - smell formation.
    - formation of hole in the cheeses.
    - Proteolisis required in the mature of cheese.
    - also used such probiotic
